This project was made using express, express-session, and express-handlebars and serves as a blog forum where users can login to the site to make posts about the latest tech trends. MySql/JawsDb was used for data persitence, so when someone visits the site, a list of previous posts from the site's users will appear on the home page. The visitor can then sign up and will be allowed to make posts of their own and reply to others who have posted to the site.
